#### Phonebook Project
- **Description**: A C++ console application to manage contacts with names and phone numbers.
- **Features**:
  - Add a contact.
  - Look up a contact using binary search (on a sorted copy).
  - Display all contacts.
  - Delete a contact by name using binary search.
  - Clear the entire phonebook.
- **Technologies**: C++, STL (vector, algorithm).

#### LeetCode Problems Solved (15)
- Arrays: **Two Sum**, **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**.
- Strings: **Valid Parentheses**, **Length of Last Word**, **Reverse String**.

- Stacks/Queues: **Min Stack**, **Implement Queue using Stacks**.
- Binary Search: **Binary Search**, **Search Insert Position**, **Find Peak Element**, **First Bad Version**, **Two Sum II – Input Array Is Sorted**.

### Week 2: May 23–29, 2025 (Trees and Heaps)
- **Goal**: Solve 15 LeetCode problems, start Calculator mini-project.
- **Focus**: Deepen DSA with trees and heaps.

#### Daily Breakdown
- **Day 1 (May 23)**:
  - Read: GeeksforGeeks “Binary Tree in C++” (30 min).
  - LeetCode: **[Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)**: Inverted a binary tree using recursion. **[Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)**: Calculated the maximum depth using recursion.
  - Project: Starting Calculator mini-project (in progress).
  - GitHub: Added LeetCode solutions, will update with Calculator repo later.

#### Future Plans
- Continue solving tree and heap problems.
- Finalize Calculator project with stack-based expression evaluation.

### Certifications
- **In Progress**: Sanfoundry Data Structure Certification (Beginner Level).
